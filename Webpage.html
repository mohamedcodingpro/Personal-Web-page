    <h2> Foreign language</h2>
    <div class="text-2">
        French is one of the foreign languages I would like to learn.
        Learning French in Africa offers numerous advantages due to its wide usage across the continent, particularly in government, trade, and tourism sectors.
        Proficiency in French opens doors to job opportunities and facilitates communication within Africa and internationally.
        Additionally, it provides access to French-speaking cultures, literature, and media, enriching cultural understanding and global perspective.

                        Robben Island, located in Table Bay, Cape Town, served as a place of imprisonment for centuries, notably housing Nelson Mandela during apartheid.
                        Initially a habitat for wildlife, it was explored by Bartholomew Diaz in 1488.
                        The Dutch later used it as a prison, leading to its UNESCO World Heritage Site designation.
                        Tours depart from V&A Waterfront daily at 9am, 11am, and 1pm, lasting 3 hours and costing $12 to $21 per person.
